How to add an additional rating calculator:

- You need to add 2 classes:

		1. A team class that extends off of teamRecord
			- In this class you need the follow public method:
					* calcRating() 	- takse no arguments
													- calculates the rating for the individual team

					** you can overload getRating is needed as long as your
							new function doesn't take any parameters

		2. A Rating class that extends off of calculatorBase
			- In this class you need the following methods:
					* addToLeague($name, $id) use the new team class you created in this class

					*updateTeam($params) update your team class with the neccesary data from the database.
						Takes an array as the only parameter, put as much or as little data that you need in the array.

					*** If you need a separate query, overload the populateLeague method

My class are in the libs folder for reference.
